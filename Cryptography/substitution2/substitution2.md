## Description

It seems that another encrypted message has been intercepted. The encryptor seems to have learned their lesson though and now there isn't any punctuation! Can you still crack the cipher?

## Solution

Once again, we have a substitution cipher to decrypt, but there is no punctuation or whitespace to help with decrypting. Fortunately, the same [online tool](https://www.guballa.de/substitution-solver) can still easily decrypt this.

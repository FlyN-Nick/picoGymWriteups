# substitution1

## Description

A second message has come in the mail, and it seems almost identical to the first one. Maybe the same thing will work again.

## Solution

This is another subsitution cipher, but we don't conveniently have the substitution alphabet again. The previous [challenge](https://github.com/FlyN-Nick/picoGymWriteups/blob/main/Cryptography/substitution0/substitution0.md) mentioned something about frequency attacks, so how about we look for an online tool that does one. We can use [this tool](https://www.guballa.de/substitution-solver) to decrypt the flag.

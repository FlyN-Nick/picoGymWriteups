# Guessing Game 1

## Description

I made a simple game to show off my programming skills. See if you can beat it!

## Solution

If we look at the Makefile, we can see that the program was compiled with the flag "-fno-stack-protector", meaning that this program will be vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks. Looking at the program, when you guess the right number from 1-100, we get to print to the console. However, we can enter up to 360 characters, yet our string is stored in a 100 character long buffer, resulting in a buffer overflow vulnerability.

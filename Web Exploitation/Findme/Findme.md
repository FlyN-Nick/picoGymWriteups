## Description

Help us test the form by submiting the username as `test` and password as `test!`

## Solution

When logging in with the provided username and password, we can see that the website quickly redirects through several webpages before arriving at `/home`. Using Chrome, we can open inspect, select the network tab and enable `Preserve log`, and log in again, capturing the redirects. We can see that the redirects have a URL parameter ID, and these URL parameters seem to be base 64 encoded, as they are alphanumeric strings (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), and one ends with `==`, the trademark padding of a base 64 string. We can use an [online decoder](https://www.base64decode.org/) to get the flag.

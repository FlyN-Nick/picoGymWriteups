# Power Cookie

## Description

Can you get the flag?
Go to this [website](http://saturn.picoctf.net:64271/) and see what you can discover.

## Solution

As suggested by the challenge name, the solution likely involves changing a cookie value. If we go to the website, we find that there are no cookies saved. However, if we click the *continue as guest* button, we see that a cookie with the name *isAdmin* is generated, with the value 0. 0 means false here, so if we change the cookie's value to 1 and refresh, the website treats us like the admin, giving us the flag.

```html
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <div class="panel panel-primary" style="margin-top:50px">
            <div class="panel-heading">
                <h3 class="panel-title" style="color:red">Red</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
                <form action="http://mercury.picoctf.net:15931/index.php" method="GET">
                    <input type="submit" value="Choose Red">
                </form>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <div class="panel panel-primary" style="margin-top:50px">
            <div class="panel-heading">
                <h3 class="panel-title" style="color:blue">Blue</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
                <form action="http://mercury.picoctf.net:15931/index.php" method="POST">
                    <input type="submit" value="Choose Blue">
                </form>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

Looking at the HTML of the website, we can see that both red and blue make a request to the same URL, however with a different HTTP request method. We can make the educated guess that the flag will be acessible by using a different HTTP request method.

Using the tool [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp), we can try HTTP requests with different request methods. Unfortunately, both "PUT" and "DELETE" do not result in the flag. Looking at the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods), we can see that there are actually 9 different HTTP request methods, one of which being "HEAD". As this challenge is named "Get aHEAD," we can conclude that we must use the "HEAD" method to get the flag.
